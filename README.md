## info 
The Game of Life is not a typical computer game. It is a cellular automaton, and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway
## The Rules

### For a space that is 'populated':

1. Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by loneliness. 
2. Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. 
3. Each cell with two or three neighbors survives. 

### For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'

1. Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
